Our project titled 'Unmanned Vessel for Pollution Monitoring' utilizes a remotecontrolled water vessel equipped with sensors to monitor water pollution levels.
The vessel incorporates an Analog TDS sensor, turbidity sensor, pH sensor,
DS18B20 temperature sensor which collectively determine water safety for
consumption according to WHO(World Health organization) standards and
A02YYUW Waterproof ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles like plastic or solid
waste in the water. These sensors are interfaced with an ESP32 microcontroller
for data collection, calibration, and analysis, enabling detailed assessment of
water quality and detection of obstacles such as plastic or solid waste. This
approach ensures effective monitoring of pollution levels in water bodies.
In the 21st century, there has been a rapid increase in technical progress, but
at the same time, there has been a worrying escalation in pollution and global
warming. The environmental difficulties we face have resulted in an increasing
shortage of potable water. Real-time water quality monitoring encounters
several obstacles in this particular situation, such as the effects of climate
change, the pressure on scarce water supplies, and the growing world
population.As a result, it is of the utmost need to develop methods that are
more resilient for the real-time monitoring of water quality indicators.
Conventional techniques of water quality assessment involve the collection of
water samples from various sources, which are then transported to a laboratory
for analysis. Collecting samples from various sections of ponds can be a
challenging task at times. This method requires a significant amount of time
and additional exertion. By employing sensors, the real-time assessment of
water quality in rural farms can significantly streamline the analysis process for
pond water, thereby reducing the time and effort required. By employing an
IoT-based methodology, water quality monitoring may be conducted
automatically through the utilization of sensors. In the proposed work, we have
developed an IoT-based wireless acquisition system for water quality
monitoring in the center as well as side areas of ponds. With three sensors, the
system gathers data from several pond areas. This water quality monitoring
system.
The fact that this system may be integrated with an aquatic boat is a
significant advantage. This integration makes it possible to collect
comprehensive samples from the pondâ€™s center as well as its sides, which
improves the accuracy of water quality analysis as a whole. The proposed
water quality monitoring system senses the data pH, Turbidity, and, TDS data
of the pond and transfers data to the cloud can be assessed by the m delivers
pond pH, turbidity, and TDS data to the cloud, where this data can be viewed
in Mobile or Laptop.
